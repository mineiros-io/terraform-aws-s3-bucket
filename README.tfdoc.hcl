    A [Terraform] base module for creating a secure [AWS S3-Bucket].

    ***This module supports Terraform v1.x, v0.15, v0.14, v0.13 as well as v0.12.20 and above
    and is compatible with the terraform AWS provider v3 as well as v2.0 and above.***
  END

  section {
    title   = "Module Features"
    content = <<-END
      In contrast to the plain `aws_s3_bucket` resource this module creates secure
      buckets by default. While all security features can be disabled as needed, best practices
      are pre-configured.

      In addition to security, easy cross-account access can be granted to the objects
      of the bucket enforcing `bucket-owner-full-control` ACL for objects created by other accounts.

      - **Default Security Settings**:
        Bucket public access blocking all set to `true` by default,
        Server-Side-Encryption (SSE) at rest `enabled` by default (AES256),
        Bucket ACL defaults to canned `private` ACL

      - **Standard S3 Features**:
        Server-Side-Encryption (SSE) enabled by default,
        Versioning,
        Bucket Logging,
        ACL Policy Grants,
        Lifecycle Rules,
        Request Payer,
        Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS),
        Acceleration Status,
        Bucket Policy,
        Tags

      - **Extended S3 Features**:
        Bucket Public Access Blocking,
        S3 Access Points

      - **Additional Features**:
        Cross-Account access policy with forced `bucket-owner-full-control` ACL for direct access,
        Create Cloudfront Origin Access Identity (OAI) and grant read-only access,
        Grant read-only access to existing Cloudfront Origin Access Identity (OAI),
        Allow ELB log delivery

      - *Features not yet implemented*:
        Enforce Encryption via a policy that blocks unencrypted uploads,
        ACL policy grants (aws-provider >= 2.52.0),
        Amazon S3 Analytics (aws-provider >= 2.49.0),
        Replication Configuration,
        Website Configuration,
        S3 Object Locking,
        Bucket Notifications,
        Bucket Metrics,
        Bucket Inventory,
        Generate Cross-Account role for OAI enabled buckets if desired,
        Generate KMS key to encrypt objects at rest if desired

            Amazon S3 Access Points simplify managing data access at scale for shared datasets in S3.

            virtual private cloud (VPC) to restrict Amazon S3 data access to a private network.
